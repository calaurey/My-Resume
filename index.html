        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>While in Japan as an Assistant Language Teacher for Interac I developed a strong sense for cultural sensitivity and a greater interest in and appreciation for different countries and cultures.
            Working in Japan, Best Buy and with the New York State police has allowed me to to build up very strong communication skills thanks to being able to experience interacting with people from a wide variety of cultures and backgrounds in various different settings. I have also learned to pay close attention to detail and deadlines thanks to my time with the New York State Police. </p>
